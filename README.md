Sure, I could try to convince you that my somewhat unconventional route into coding was, in fact, serendipitously perfect preparation for this role. But a Chemistry degree, a brief foray into the world of banking, and a stint as a property manager-cum-kitchen installer is nothing of the sort.

What I would like to draw your attention to however, is the common thread running through my career to date, which is an insatiable desire for learning, a rather masochistic fascination with remaining at the very limit of my comfort zone, and an uncanny ability to enthuse those around me, however odious the task.

>**[404](https://github.com/missamynicholson/ft_origami_404)** is a topical 404 page I am creating in order to learn about [Origami](http://origami.ft.com). It is based on the FT Labs project which aimed to create an exciting 404 page which wouldn't leave FT readers disappointed if they landed on it.

>[<img src="/images/phlash_icon.png" width="100">](https://github.com/missamynicholson/phlash)

>**[Phlash](https://github.com/missamynicholson/phlash)** is a photo messaging app built in Swift. In 12 days, our team of 4: learnt Swift from scratch; hooked up a BaaS; integrated Apple Push notifications; implemented security measures such as ACLs and Cloud Code; took the app (successfully) through Apple Beta Review; and [presented it live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKXFheulB-8) on the Makers Academy YouTube channel. *If you like phlashing people, you can join our ever-growing community of beta testers - just email phlashapp@gmail.com.*

>[<img src="/images/memeories_icon.png" width="100">](https://github.com/missamynicholson/memeories)

>**[Memeories](https://github.com/missamynicholson/memeories)** is a web app which allows students to create and share a meme with colleagues via their Slack channel. Memeories was built in 4.5 days using Rails, Heroku, AWS, several APIs and a Slack webhook.

<a name="stealthie">
>[<img src="/images/stealthie_icon.png" width="100">]()</a>

>**[Stealthie]()** is an iOS app which automatically captures your reaction to a photo using the front-facing camera. Prior to Makers Academy, I learnt Objective-C from YouTube videos, online tutorials and StackOverflow. My first app was Stealthie, which passed the Apple Review process first time and went live on the App Store. It was downloaded and used by people all over the world.


### The Work Experience<a name="work"></a>

>Property Manager, **Hot Property** *(February 2013 - February 2016)*

  >I referenced tenants, drew up contracts, liaised with council officers over HMO (Houses of Multiple Occupation) legislation compliance, responded to emergencies, organised contractors, and even installed a few new  kitchens and bathrooms, including all the plumbing and electrics. It was the housing equivalent of  extreme problem solving and fast debugging.
<Br>


>Deal Flow Manager, **Owner Venture Managers** *(August 2012 - February 2013)*

  >I worked on the sourcing, profiling, and onboarding of companies which fitted the investment criteria. In hindsight, I was unwittingly honing my agile methodology skills as this role required early delivery and rapid response to change as the investment criteria was tweaked daily: one day I would be speaking to companies in the UK, and the next day, Japan.
<Br>

>Wealth Management Intern, **Barclays Wealth** *(June 2011 - Sept 2011)*

  >A highly competitive paid internship. I worked on the RND (resident non-domiciled) team which managed the portfolio of RNDs with £10m+ of investable assets. The role required the fast absorption of a gargantuan amount of information, although the main challenge was negotiating the office politics which required every XP value, and then some.
