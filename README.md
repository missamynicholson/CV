### The Atypical Opener
Sure, I could list all the skills that you're looking for, and boldly claim that, by sheer hapchance, those exact skills were clearly demonstrable in a plethora of my previous roles. Then I could heinously over-inflate my achievements and responsibilities in said roles in the vain hope that you'd be bamboozled by the BS.

But in the immortal words of Kimberly "Sweet Brown" Wilkins, [*"Ain't nobody got time for that"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGxwbhkDjZM). So, instead, here are some juicy bits you might be interested in, minus the self-congratulatory over-exaggeration.

>**[404](https://github.com/missamynicholson/ft_origami_404)** is a topical 404 page I am creating in order to learn about [Origami](http://origami.ft.com). It is based on the FT Labs project which aimed to create an exciting 404 page which wouldn't leave FT readers disappointed if they landed on it.

>**[Phlash](https://github.com/missamynicholson/phlash)** is a photo messaging app built in Swift. In 12 days, our team of 4: learnt Swift from scratch; hooked up a BaaS; integrated Apple Push notifications; implemented security measures such as ACLs and Cloud Code; took the app (successfully) through Apple Beta Review; and [presented it live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKXFheulB-8) on the Makers Academy YouTube channel. *If you like phlashing people, you can join our ever-growing community of beta testers - just email phlashapp@gmail.com.*
