### The Atypical Opener
Sure, I could list a bunch of generic skills I think you're looking for, and boldly claim that, by sheer hapchance, those exact skills were clearly demonstrable in a plethora of my previous roles. Then I could heinously over-inflate my achievements and responsibilities in said roles, perhaps bandying the terms "effective communicator" and "can-do attitude" about a bit, all in the vain hope that you'd be bamboozled by the BS.

But in the immortal words of Kimberly "Sweet Brown" Wilkins, [*"Ain't nobody got time for that"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGxwbhkDjZM). So, instead, here are some juicy bits you might be interested in, minus the self-congratulatory over-exaggeration.

### The Reviews

Here are some far too generous reviews I've garnered from brilliant (and somewhat less sarcastic) people you might like to hire instead.<sup>*</sup>
